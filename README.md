button.html
-----------

This code gets copy/pasted to four places (well, two places, each with a Deutsch and English version).

* On the home page the code is copy/pasted into a "Code" module just after the "godibox" button. _Do not_ include the top `div`. Only copy/paste the `script` tag plus its contents.
* On the Gottesdienst / Worship Service page, we don't have a proper "Visual Builder" button. It's actually just a `div`. That's what the `div` tag is all about in `button.html`. _Everything_ in `button.html` gets pasted to a code module on the Gottesdienst / Worship Service page.
